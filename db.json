Simple carbohydrates consist of simple sugars and are quickly processed by the body. Examples of foods that contain simple carbohydrates are sodas, syrups, and candy. Complex carbohydrates take longer to process and are digested slowly by the body. Examples of foods that contain complex carbohydrates are whole wheat bread, legumes, and brown rice. Complex carbohydrates should make up the majority of your diet. The average person should be consuming about 275 grams of total carbohydrates a day.
