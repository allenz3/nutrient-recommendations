# Nutrient Recommendations

Link to Deployed Application: https://nutrient-recommendations.firebaseapp.com/

Disclaimer: The information from the application is intended as a suggestion, and not as medical fact. If you have any questions regarding your personal nutritional needs, please contact a professional.

My application will ask users to input their age and other relevant information and then show them their personalized nutritional intake recommendations. Many people are aware of dietary groups but do not have a concrete understanding of different nutrients and the key roles they play in the bodyâ€™s function. In the process of collecting information and making this application, I hope to also become more knowledgeable about nutrition and web development.

Part of UN Sustainable Development Goal #2 involves providing everyone with adequate nutrition. People from all walks of life can struggle with finding personalized nutritional information, and my web application will try to resolve some of the confusion surrounding that topic. For example, a person who is in their mid-twenties and exercises every day may want to know what their recommended nutrient intake is. I want to help fill that informational need.

The application is very simple. The left side of the page is the user input for the application. Here, you can input your biometrics, such as your weight, height, age, and activity level. The application accepts both metric and US customary units. The middle section of the page will then display your recommended nutrient intake based on your biometrics when you hit the "Calculate" button. You can update the recommended nutrient intake values by inputting new user input and then hitting the "Calculate" button again. If you want to learn more about a nutrient, you can click on the nutrient text and the nutrient's information will appear on the right side of the page. A disclaimer is also included.

The application is in a finished state; however, updates will be implemented in the future to improve the application functionality.
